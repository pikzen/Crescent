Crescent
========

Crescent is a Direct3D11 renderer. It can load .obj models along with their texture, render them in a 3D space, and that's about all.

It's mainly made for training in C++ & D3D. Don't expect anything out of it. I might add deferred shading, one day. Refactoring would also be a good idea.
